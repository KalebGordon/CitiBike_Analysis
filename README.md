# CitiBike_Analysis

## Overview
Before planning to create a bikesharing company after a trip to New York, we must first analyze data gathered by a bikesharing company, CitiBike. Using this data, we can visualize factors that make a bikesharing company successful, and we can visualize trends in the data to focus our efforts correctly when starting the business.

## Results
Using Tableau, we analyzed the CitiBike data for Manhatten and we found many trends and visualized them.
